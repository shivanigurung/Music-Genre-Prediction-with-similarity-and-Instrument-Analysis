# Music-Genre-Prediction-with-similarity-and-Instrument-Analysis 
In this project, I’ll examine the audio features extracted from the dataset and build various types of ensemble
models to see how well we can distinguish one genre from another
and differentiate instruments. Used two data sets GTZAN dataset
and the IRMAS dataset to apply these approaches and features to
this study. Investigating music sound documents because of types
and other subjective labels is a functioning field of exploration
in AI. When matched with individual order calculations, most
quite support vector machines (SVMs) and k-closest neighbor
classifiers (KNNs), certain highlights, including Mel-Frequency
Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Chroma attributes, and other
spectral properties, have been demonstrated to be powerful
elements for grouping music by type. To discover trends and
patterns from massive volumes of data, machine learning techniques have shown to be quite successful.

The creation of functionalities demands knowledge and in-depth understanding of the audio and
music domain. The characteristics of various categorization tasks are sometimes not universal 
and complete. Because of manual and traditional machine learning approaches, extracting music 
characteristics is tough when we don’t have proper knowledge about the relevant field.
As a result, the contribution of this study is to transform a music audio signal into a proper 
visualization of a sound spectrum as a so removing the issue of human feature selection for the 
better understanding of the audio or music dataset. According to a research people usually like 
recommendations that take music genres into account like pop, rock etc., over those that are 
merely focused on similarity. Exploring more of MFCC characteristics for the audio data set to 
train better and attain a higher accuracy score.
